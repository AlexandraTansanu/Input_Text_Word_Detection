# Text input word detection
Written as an exercise in the first academic year, this is a simple Java text input program capable of detecting specific words. 

The program works by continually updating a string, also referred to as a typing string, which receives input until the return key is pressed. After this action, the content of the typing string is stored in a list. If 'quit' is inputted, the typing string will not receive any new input and all saved strings in the list will be displayed. 

Additionally, the exercise is designed to identify any trigger words stored in advance in a text file. These words are identifiable even strings containing no spaces. If a match is found, the trigger word will be highlighted in red. Otherwise, the text will be displayed in green.
